Checking Out the GitLab Project
===============================

You may now clone the “Microfinance” project from GitLab to look at the source code using the following command. 
Open a terminal in any directory in your computer where you wish to clone the project: ::

   git clone https://gitlab.com/gmc123/microfinance.git

There are three projects in the ``microfinance`` root directory. 
We should change the current directory to the ``microfinance`` directory using following command in the current terminal, ::

   cd microfinance/

This will change your directory to the ``microfinance`` directory.  There are three levels of the “Microfinance” project, as explained in `Functionalities <https://microfinance-dapp.readthedocs.io/en/level1/introduction/functionalities.html>`_.

Check the current git branch using the following command. ::

   git branch

It should show you that you are at the ``master`` branch.
We first focus on the ``level1`` branch, the easiest level. Change git branch to ``level1`` branch as follows: ::

   git branch level1
   git branch

In the next section we discuss about the project structure and deployment.
